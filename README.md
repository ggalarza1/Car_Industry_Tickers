# Car_Industry_Tickers
This notebook shows how to put five tickers in one graph. Here we have five companies and how they are performing in the stock market.

On this notebook, I am pulling the data using the Yahoo finance API and graphing it.
If you change the ticker names, you can graph any industry in the stock market.

You may need to download the following libraries if you don't already have them.
```
pip install yfinance
pip install matplotlib
pip install pandas
```
